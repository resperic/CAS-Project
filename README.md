Final Project for CMPS 203, Spring 2019



Abstract

This project was to implement an AST interpreter for a simple computer algebra system [CAS]. This CAS can 
perform calculator-like computations, simplify simple algebraic expressions, solve a class of equations including 
linear, exponential, and logarithmic equations. It can also take derivatives of a number of algebraic expressions, 
including polynomial, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric expressions. Implementing integration and plotting 
functionality were not attempted.
